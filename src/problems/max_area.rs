/// Problem: Container With Most Water
///
/// You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn
/// such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
///
/// Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that can hold the most water.
/// Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
///
/// Notice that you may not slant the container.
///
/// Example 1:
/// Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
/// Output: 49
/// Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7].
/// In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
///
/// Example 2:
/// Input: height = [1,1]
/// Output: 1
///
/// Constraints:
/// - n == height.length
/// - 2 <= n <= 10^5
/// - 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4
///
/// Hints:
/// 1. Use two pointers approach starting from both ends
/// 2. Area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
/// 3. Move the pointer with smaller height inward
/// 4. Why? Moving the taller line can't increase area with current shorter line
///
/// Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass with two pointers
/// Space Complexity: O(1) - only using constant extra space
