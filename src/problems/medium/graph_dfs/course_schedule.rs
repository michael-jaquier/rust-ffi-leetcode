/// Problem: Course Schedule
///
/// There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1.
/// You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you
/// must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
///
/// Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.
///
/// Example 1:
/// Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
/// Output: true
/// Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
/// To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
///
/// Example 2:
/// Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
/// Output: false
/// Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
/// To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also
/// have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
///
/// Constraints:
/// - 1 <= numCourses <= 2000
/// - 0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
/// - prerequisites[i].length == 2
/// - 0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
/// - All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.
///
/// Algorithm Pattern: Graph Cycle Detection / Topological Sort
/// This class of problems can be solved with Graph algorithms when you need to:
/// - Detect cycles in directed graphs
/// - Find valid ordering of dependencies
/// - Schedule tasks with prerequisites
/// - Check if directed graph is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
///
/// Translation Strategy:
/// English: "Can all courses be completed given prerequisites?"
/// Algorithm: Build dependency graph, check for cycles using topological sort
///
/// Common Graph Patterns:
/// 1. Topological Sort (Kahn's algorithm) - this problem
/// 2. DFS with coloring (white/gray/black) for cycle detection
/// 3. Union-Find for undirected graph connectivity
/// 4. BFS/DFS for path finding and connectivity
/// 5. Dijkstra/Bellman-Ford for shortest paths
///
/// Key Insight: Course schedule is valid if and only if dependency graph has no cycles
///
/// Hints:
/// 1. Model as directed graph: edge from prerequisite to course
/// 2. Use Kahn's algorithm: repeatedly remove nodes with 0 in-degree
/// 3. Build adjacency list from prerequisites array
/// 4. Track in-degree (number of prerequisites) for each course
/// 5. If can process all courses, no cycle exists
/// 6. Alternative: DFS with recursion stack to detect back edges
///
/// Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is numCourses, E is prerequisites length
/// Space Complexity: O(V + E) for adjacency list and auxiliary data structures

    // TODO: Implement topological sort (Kahn's algorithm)
    //
    // Your implementation should:
    // 1. Build adjacency list from prerequisites
    //    - For each [course, prereq]: add edge prereq -> course
    // 2. Calculate in-degree for each course (number of prerequisites)
    // 3. Initialize queue with all courses having 0 in-degree
    // 4. While queue not empty:
    //    a. Remove course from queue (can be taken now)
    //    b. For each course that depends on removed course:
    //       - Decrease its in-degree by 1
    //       - If in-degree becomes 0, add to queue
    // 5. Return true if processed all courses, false if cycle exists
    //
    // Alternative DFS approach:
    // - Use white/gray/black coloring
    // - Gray nodes are in current DFS path (recursion stack)
    // - If we reach a gray node, we found a back edge (cycle)
    //
    // Data structures needed:
    // - Vec<Vec<i32>>: adjacency list
    // - Vec<i32>: in-degree array
    // - VecDeque<i32>: queue for BFS
